# react-attachment-kit

A complete React component kit for handling file attachments. react-attachment-kit provides both a clean, collapsible card layout to display your file list and a powerful, interactive modal to preview them.

> Check out the live demo **[here](https://react-attachment-kit.vercel.app)**.

It features specialized viewers for different file types:

- **Interactive Image Viewer**: Zoom up to 200%, pan, and drag to explore high-resolution images
- **Advanced Video Player**: Custom controls with seek, playback speed, and YouTube-style ambient mode blur effect
- **Integrated PDF Viewer**: Navigate through multi-page documents with built-in page controls
- **Graceful Fallback**: Clean unsupported file screen for documents and other file types

## Installation

Install the package along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-attachment-kit react-pdf media-chrome
```

**Requirements:**

- React 18.3.1 or higher
- No Tailwind CSS installation required (styles are included)

## Usage

Import the component and its styles:

```jsx
import Attachments from 'react-attachment-kit';
import 'react-attachment-kit/dist/style.css';

function App() {
  const files = [
    {
      id: '1',
      name: 'vacation-photo.jpg',
      type: 'image/jpeg',
      url: 'https://example.com/photo.jpg',
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      name: 'presentation.pdf',
      type: 'application/pdf',
      url: 'https://example.com/presentation.pdf',
    },
  ];

  return <Attachments files={files} collapsible />;
}
```

**Important:** Make sure to import the CSS file (`'react-attachment-kit/dist/style.css'`) for the component to display correctly.
